# Travel Journal

The **Travel Journal** project is a static web page built using React, where I created a dynamic journal to display a list of travel destinations. This project allowed me to practice and enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while exploring the power of React for building reusable components.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Used to structure and style the web page.
- **Reusable Components:** Created a *Card* component named as *Entry* to represent each destination, which can be reused with different data.
- **Props in React:** Learned how to pass data into components using props, enabling dynamic content rendering for each destination.
- **Rendering Lists of Components:** Used React’s `map()` method to dynamically render a list of *Card* components based on an array of destination data.

## Project Details

In this project, I created a reusable *Card* component that accepts props, such as the location, date of visit, description, and image, allowing each instance of the component to display unique information. By using this approach, I was able to keep my code modular and scalable.

Additionally, I learned how to dynamically render a list of components by storing destination data in an array and mapping over the array to generate multiple *Card* components. This practice reinforced my understanding of iterating over data and making the page more dynamic and efficient.

## Skills Practiced

- React Components
- Props and State
- Dynamic Rendering of Lists
- HTML & CSS Layouts
- Basic JavaScript Functions

## Conclusion

This project serves as a solid foundation for building more complex React applications, while solidifying key web development concepts in the context of modern JavaScript frameworks. It was a great opportunity to practice component reusability, props, and rendering lists in React.
